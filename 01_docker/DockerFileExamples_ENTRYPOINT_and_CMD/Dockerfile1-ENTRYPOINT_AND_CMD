FROM python:latest
# download a Linux image with python tool environment installed and configured
# ---- so far same image for all developers in the whole World --------

# next you could do some file publication or so, with the
#  COPY (local) or ADD (www...) commands. Or build something using the RUN 
RUN echo "print('Hello, Dockerfile World!')" > app.py
# This creates a file called app.py to the container = currently built image

# Or define some ENV variables here before the python code started

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# after building the image, set how it would start at "docker run"
# or docker-compose up:

# ENTRYPOINT sets the main command that always runs when the container starts. 
# It is meant to define the container’s default executable.
# CMD provides default arguments for ENTRYPOINT 
# _or_ sets a command to run if ENTRYPOINT is not specified.
# CMD can be overridden at runtime. ENTRYPOINT cannot.

ENTRYPOINT ["python"]
CMD ["app.py"]

# =>   python app.py
# the 'app.py' part, the CMD can be easily changed in the docker run command

# ----- Command to test this Dockerfile at bottom, remove the # naturally ----
# build image, give it temp name, run that image (using given name) as
# container, remove that container rightr afterwards, remove the image 
# using the name

# docker build -t temp_image -f Dockerfile1-ENTRYPOINT_AND_CMD . && docker run --rm temp_image && docker rmi temp_image
