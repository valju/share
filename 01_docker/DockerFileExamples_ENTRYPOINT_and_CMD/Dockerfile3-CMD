FROM nginx
# download a Linux image with nginx installed and configured
# ---- so far same image for all developers in the whole World --------

# next you could do some file publication or so, with the
#  COPY or ADD commands. Or build something using the RUN command

# Or define some ENV variables here before the nginx server started

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# after building the image, set how it would start at "docker run"
# or docker-compose up:

CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

# =>   nginx -g daemon off;
