# How we use Wihi to support the thesis process

1. Fast meeting minutes with the "Send comment"/"Kirjoita viesti" feature
    - Write your fast notes *during* the meeting. 
    - E.g. what are the target dates
    - possible holidays etc. 
    - what was discussed, etc. has Mendeley been taken into use 
    - Advisor might have 30 thesis writers, not possible to remember what was covered otherwise
    - preferably post immediately after the meeting, or same day, or asap

2. New and new versions of the thesis report with "Upload file"/"Lataa tiedosto". Not limited for one per phase or something. Unlimited uploads.
    - PLEASE in _PDF_ format and date (&time) stamp at the end, like ThesisDraft_SmithMichael_2026_12_31.pdf or similar. Thanks!

## What we typically do NOT do in Wihi

* The Tasks feature I have decided not to use. Too much extra work and email notifications.

* With meetings and meeting arrangements we maybe deal in Teams? (or email)
