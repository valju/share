# How we use Wihi

1. Fast meeting minutes with the "Send comment"/"Kirjoita viesti" feature
    - Write your fast notes during the meeting. E.g. what are the target dates, what was discussed, etc.
    - Advisor might have 30 thesis writers, not possible to remember what was covered otherwise

2. New and new versions of the thesis report with "Upload file"/"Lataa tiedosto". Not limited for one per phase or something. Unlimited uploads.
    - PLEASE in _PDF_ format and date (&time) stamp at the end, like ThesisDraft_SmithMichael_2026_12_31.pdf or similar. Thanks!

## What we typically do not do in Wihi

* The Task features I have decided not to use. Too much extra work.

* With meetings and meeting arrangements we maybe deal in Teams? (or email)
